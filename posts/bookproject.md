_**Update:** I originally wrote this post in August of 2023, and I'm updating it on January 16, 2024. You can see the [original version on GitHub](https://github.com/dpersing/netlify-site/blob/2a48c4cfde69386d170071c2d0d31917b9f134d0/posts/bookproject.md)._

I'm writing a book called _The Accessibility Operations Guidebook_, which I plan to launch in 2024 as a digital publication.

## What this book is about

This book includes:

- A deep dive into why burnout is rampant in our field and how that is affecting us, including (anonymized) stories from accessibility practitioners.
- Frameworks and theories of information literacy, organization theory, and community from my formal background in information science and other aspects of my experience that I've applied to my practice.
- Practical guidance on identifying organizational needs, scoping work, and implementing accessibility programs and services that create change.

## Who this book is for

This book is primarily for accessibility practitioners: anyone who's trying to make accessibility programming and operations happen at an organization. It's especially for accessibility specialists who find themselves in over their heads, or who are interested in growing their skills in areas like change management, program management, and operations. Secondarily, it's for anyone who is trying to support that kind of work: managers, team leads, colleagues, and so on, as well as those that work at the intersections of other DEI programs.

## How you can help

To help me stay accountable and offset the cost of doing the project, I've set up a [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/a11ydevon). There, you can follow project updates and contribute financially. Contributions are set at a minimum of $5 USD because that's the minimum that Ko-Fi requires for the features I'm using, but you can change this to whatever you'd like to give.

**For a one-time contribution**, you will:

- Pre-order an accessible, digital copy of *The Accessibility Operations Guidebook*

**As a monthly supporter**, you will:

- Pre-order an accessible, digital copy of *The Accessibility Operations Guidebook*
- Get access to chapter drafts as I complete them
- Be able to contribute feedback on chapter drafts as they are released
- Be able to contribute feedback to the whole manuscript once it's complete

Basically, being a monthly supporter means you don't have to wait to read the book, _and_ you'll have ongoing access to the content in its most unpolished and unfiltered form before I do major edits.

## Contact me with comments or questions

If you have a question about the project or Ko-Fi, you can send me an email through my [contact](/contact) page.
