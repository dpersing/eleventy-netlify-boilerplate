**Updated November 1, 2024:** The recording of [my talk is up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15U3sZmXL4I)!

On August 27, 2024, I had the pleasure of giving a talk about accessible UX at the [Web Accessibility in Mind](https://conference.webaim.org/) conference. I don't really do design work much anymore, so giving a design talk felt a little strange. However, I pitched the idea because I wanted to talk about something that doesn't often get attentionâ€”namely, UX concerns for people with chronic illnesses and people who are neurodivergent (who are often the same people).

I'm really grateful to the folks at WebAIM for letting me give this talk, and I was so encouraged to hear other speakers bring up cognitive issues as well. I had many requests for my slides, so I wanted to simply share the deck via GoogleDrive. Just be warned that it's a chonky file that contains a few video files. Please feel free to use it and the many resources I cite in the speaker notes in your own advocacy work.
