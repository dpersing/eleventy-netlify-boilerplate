The _[Accessibility Operations Guidebook](/book/index.html)_ is now available for purchase as an ebook!

This book is a loveletter to the accessibility field. Here's the full blurb:

>The accessibility field has a burnout problem. People get into this work to make accessible products and services. But, they often find themselves doing a lot of other work—program management, legal compliance, and constant, constant advocacy—instead. This isn't usually what people sign up for, and it leads directly to burnout.
>
>This book seeks to help break that cycle. It's not about accessibility work itself, but about building digital accessibility programs that are more sustainable, intersectional, and data-driven.
>
>The first part of the book is a crash course in social science. It introduces theories about organizational psychology, community, education, information literacy, work burnout, disability, and intersectionality.
>
>The second part is a strategy guide. It takes the theories from the first part and applies them to building an accessibility practice that better fits your needs and those of your organization. It's about using data and systems thinking to help you focus on the hard work of growing community, centering disability and disabled people, and enabling accessibility instead of policing it.
