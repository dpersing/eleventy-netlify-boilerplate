There is a strong tendency among digital accessibility practitioners to put their work before themselves, leading to burnout. I know that firsthand, and this book is a tool to help you avoid that.

This book is two things. The first is a crash course in frameworks and ways of thinking from fields like information science, organizational theory, and DEI. The second is a walkthrough of building and operationalizing sustainable, data-driven accessibility programming. The focus is always on saving your time and energy for the long haul, while centering the needs and realities of the disabled people you're serving.

This first edition of _The Accessibility Operations Guidebook_ will be available as a DRM-free EPUB through Payhip, as well as in paperback and Kindle (MOBI) formats from Amazon.
