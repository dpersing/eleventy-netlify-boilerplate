There is a strong tendency among digital accessibility practitioners to put their work before themselves, leading to burnout. I know that firsthand, and this book is a tool to help you avoid that.

This book is two things. The first is a crash course in frameworks and ways of thinking from fields like information science, organizational theory, and DEI. The second is a walkthrough of building and operationalizing sustainable, data-driven accessibility programming. The focus is always on saving your time and energy for the long haul, while centering the needs and realities of the disabled people you're serving.
