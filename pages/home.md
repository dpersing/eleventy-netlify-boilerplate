I’m an independent digital accessibility consultant who focuses on accessibility education and operations. I help organizations create accessibility programming and workflows that are sustainable and center equity and inclusion for disabled people.

I've written a book called [_The Accessibility Operations Guidebook_](/book/), which is currently in beta review. It should be available in fall of 2024.
