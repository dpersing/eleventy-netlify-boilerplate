# Hi, I'm Devon Persing (she/her)

I’m an independent accessibility specialist and mentor based in Seattle, WA, USA. I approach accessibility holistically, practically, and strategically.

I’ve worked in agencies, product companies, non-profits, ecommerce, higher education, and social services. I love mentoring folks who are looking to grow as accessibility professionals, as well as working with organizations to improve their accessibility thinking, processes, workflows, and education.
