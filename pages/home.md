I’m an independent digital accessibility consultant who focuses on accessibility education and operations. I help organizations create accessibility programming and workflows that center equity and inclusion for disabled people. I also mentor folks who are new to the accessibility space to help them grow their skills in UX design, research, and programming.

I've written a book called [_The Accessibility Operations Guidebook_](/book/), which will be available in fall of 2024.
