# Hi, I'm Devon Persing

I’m an accessibility specialist and mentor based in Seattle, WA, USA. I approach accessibility holistically, practically, and strategically, with the understanding that the creation of inaccessible spaces and products is rooted in ableism and other forms of oppression.

I’ve worked in agencies, product companies, non-profits, ecommerce, higher education, and social services. I love mentoring and working with people to build their skills around how accessibility work intersects with UX, change management, operations, training, community, and knowledge management.
