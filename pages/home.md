# Hi, I'm Devon Persing

I’m an accessibility specialist and mentor based in Seattle, WA, USA. I approach accessibility holistically, practically, and strategically.

I’ve worked in agencies, product companies, non-profits, ecommerce, higher education, and social services. I love mentoring and working with people to build their skills around how accessibility work intersects with UX, change management, operations, training, community, and knowledge management.
