# Designing accessibility operations in organizations

This essay started with the idea that teaching digital accessibility in organizations is difficult, which is a topic I spoke about at A11yTO Conf in 2019. However, the longer I've looked at the problem, the more I've realized the issue is not with teaching or learning, exactly. **The issue is that it's hard to make accessibility work contextual and actionable for organizations.**

My intention here is to explore some different ways of doing accessibility education in organizations, with the goal of providing practical advice on how to create sustainable and scalable accessibility education programs. This concept will be broken down into three parts:

- Services
- Literacy
- Operations

## Services

## Literacy

## Operations
