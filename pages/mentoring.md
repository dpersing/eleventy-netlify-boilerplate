# Mentoring

Are you looking to get into the digital accessibility field, or need support in navigating it? I offer personalized mentoring services that can help.

## Getting to know you

To get started, I ask that you set up a [45-minute getting-to-know-you Zoom call](https://calendly.com/devon-persing/getting-to-know-you). This is so we can connect and make sure I'm a good fit for what you're looking for in a mentor. This is your opportunity to tell me about yourself and what you're seeking in mentorship.

## Mentoring session

This is a [1-hour mentoring/coaching Zoom call](https://calendly.com/devon-persing/mentoring-coaching-session) to discuss your dreams, challenges, and needs around getting into or doing digital accessibility work. We'll collaborate to find strategies, resources, and reasonable, measurable goals that work for you so you feel like you're making progress. We can meet as few or as many times as you need.

**A 60 USD fee per session is requested but not required for this service.** Payment can be made before or after the session to [@a11ydevon on Venmo](https://account.venmo.com/u/a11ydevon).

**Payment is absolutely not required nor expected if you are experiencing financial hardship for any reason.** These reasons include but are not limited to: disability, unemployment, immigrant or refugee status, being unhoused, or systemic oppression because of your race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, etc.

## Quick checkin

Just want to say hi, have a quick chat, or follow up on a mentoring session? You can book a [30-minute quick checkin Zoom call](https://calendly.com/devon-persing/quick-check-in) to get me up to date.

## Further questions

Have more questions about these sessions, their format, or need an accommodation not included here? [Contact](/contact/index.html) me to let me know, and we'll make it work.
