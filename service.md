First, let’s start with service. [The Principles of Service Design Thinking](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-principles-of-service-design-thinking-building-better-services) says, "Work is always structured around processes and not around internal constructs.” Service work is more than our individual roles, the tasks we do, what we call things, or the artifacts we create. It's a system that ties all those things together and takes into account the work that goes into tending and sustaining the whole.

## Services are systems

To take an example from the built environment, a city bus system is a type of service. It's a service that allows riders to move around a city or other area. However, you can't have a bus system without:

- buses
- drivers
- mechanics
- funding for maintenance and repairs
- functioning roads
- clear (and accessible!) signage and signals on the bus and at bus stops
- a schedule for riders to know when they can use the bus
- communication systems for riders to provide feedback and ask questions
- emergency procedures for inclement weather and other eventualities

Services as a whole can break down very quickly when we don’t have the people, resources, materials, and information we need to support them, even if they are well designed in theory.

While an accessibility program isn't exactly the same as a bus, it's not that far off. We want to be able to create accessibility services that people can access when they need help, and that will help get them where they're going along their accessibility journey.
